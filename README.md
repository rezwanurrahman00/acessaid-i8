## Project Summary
AccessAid is an assistive-technology application that applies AI/ML to improve daily accessibility for persons with disabilities.  
For Capstone 1 we will target a focused use case (e.g., communication support or task assistance) and deliver an MVP with an accessible UI.  
Capstone 2 will expand features, polish UX, and add scalable cloud components.
